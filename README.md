# GameDevTV-Unity3D-ObstacleCourse
This is a small obstacle course I created as part of the GameDev.TV Unity 3D course.

## Aim of the Game
You play as a character that has to progress through a obstacle course to get to the next level. Many of the main gameplay features have been created but have yet to be inplimented. These features along with others will be added once i learn more about C#, Unity, and Blender.

## Updates
### v1.0.0
Many of the gameplay features have been added but have yet to be implimented into the levels.
